Our company consists of three main teams: Software, Systems and\n                        Digital\n                        Marketing. Each team follows an Agile methodology that works best for the group, and we track\n                        our\n                        work and progress through Jira and Asana to communicate throughout the company.\n                    </p>\n                    <hr>\n                    <h2>Software<span class=\"h2-bg\" data-aos=\"fade-right\" data-aos-=\"\"></span></h2>\n                    <p>\n                        The Software Team follows Scrum as a framework – meaning it is a self-organizing,\n                        cross-functional\n                        team, and no team leader decides which person will do which task or how a problem will be\n                        solved.\n                        Those are issues decided by the team as a whole.

As part of the 2-week sprint planning cycle, we hold a series of\n                        standing meetings:\n                    </p>\n                    <h3>Sprint Planning Session:</h3>\n                    <p>\n                        Sprint planning sessions are held at the beginning of each sprint.
