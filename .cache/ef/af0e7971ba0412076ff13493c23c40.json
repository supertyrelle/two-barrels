Each team follows an Agile methodology that works best for the group, and we track\n                        our\n                        work and progress through Jira and Asana to communicate throughout the company.\n                    </p>\n                    <hr>\n                    <h2>Software<span class=\"h2-bg\" data-aos=\"fade-right\" data-aos-=\"\"></span></h2>\n                    <p>\n                        The Software Team follows Scrum as a framework â€“ meaning it is a self-organizing,\n                        cross-functional\n                        team, and no team leader decides which person will do which task or how a problem will be\n                        solved.\n                        Those are issues decided by the team as a whole.

As part of the 2-week sprint planning cycle, we hold a series of\n                        standing meetings:\n                    </p>\n                    <h3>Sprint Planning Session:</h3>\n                    <p>\n                        Sprint planning sessions are held at the beginning of each sprint.
