<h1 align="">Two Barrels Prototype (Unaffiliated)</h1>
<p align="">A flexible and static website prototype for Two Barrels, a Software, Networking, Engineering, and Web Design company based in Spokane, Washington.<p>
<h4>Live site is at <a target="_blank" href="https://shuffo.com>https://shuffo.com</a>.</h4>
<p>The idea behind this project was to re-imagine this brand's web presence by centering the main colors/theme around an original illustration and also display the skills and overall methods that I bring to front-end development.</p>
<p>I created this project using HTML, SCSS (no frameworks) and vanilla javascript, in tandem with Parcel as my bundler of choice. The website itself is hosted through DigitalOcean on a standard LAMP-stack droplet.</p>
<h4>Quick shoutout to Zach Thomson for making an amazing illustration that features the Monroe Street Bridge! He's a UX Designer, check out this work <a target="_blank" href="https://dribbble.com/zthomsondesigns">here</a>.</h4>
<h3>Insights</h3>
<p>All pages and resources of the production folder weigh out at around <strong>3.2~MB</strong>. Current Google pagespeed analytic scores at the time of publishing range anywhere between high 80s-98 on mobile and mid to high 90s on desktop.</p>
<p>When added to the home screen as a shortcut, the website can function lightly as a PWA, as it removes the browser margins on devices such as the iPhone. No offline data, or notification system is currently implemented.</p>
<p>The apply/contact forms do not validate information or send information anywhere, the social media links are dead and all of the job listings redirect to a sole job description, just in case you thought something might have been broken.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
