 <main id="swup" class="office-culture-wrapper"> <section class="content container transition-fade"> <h1>How to get a Job Here</h1> <hr>  <div class="details"> <span class="white-text"> <h2>Just so you know...<span class="h2-bg" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-=""></span></h2> <p>We want to hire as much talent as possible for developing software, networking, and making awesome websites, so theway we hire is a little different than you might expect.</p> <ul class="bold-ul"> <li>We're always hiring</li> <p> Awesome potential candidates fall through the cracks when we post a job, get 150 apps, and can’t read them all. So we try to look at applications as they come in. </p> <li>Show us something</li> <p> You’d think it’s common sense, but it’s amazing how many times we get only vague resumes and cover letters, github links with no code that actually shows your skills, or links to websites you might have helped make but with no description of the work you actually did. Frankly, normal wastes a lot of our time. We’re always interested in hiring new talent, but the ball is in your court to show us something relevant to why we should hire you. </p> <li>Here’s a related, yet kind of random tangent/digression</li> <p> We know software engineers, developers, and networking people may not be experts at writing resumes and cover letters, so we give them an equal chance to show their skills. If you think about it, writing a resume and cover letter is weird. If you are highly skilled at writing one, that doesn’t mean you’re an amazing developer. It’s not like you write resumes every day and have become proficient at it. Why should we judge you based off a three page document you suck at writing and that probably exaggerates what you’re capable of? If your experience matches what we’re looking for, we’ll send you a coding test so you can really demonstrate your skills. </p> <li>We want to talk to you</li> <p>Writers and marketers, on the other hand, should be really good at writing resumes and cover letters, but we still need to talk to you in person to see if you can walk the walk. Fit is of the utmost importance to us. It won’t work if you’re really good at what you do but won’t be a good addition to our team. </p> <li>Our platform allows us to talk to everyone</li> <p>Man, there are so many really awesome people with great attitudes, who are super smart, enthusiastic, and energetic, and who aren’t jerks to their co-workers. We’d love to talk to you. We’re guilty of looking at your resumes and being like… we’re a super busy team and, because of that, don’t have a lot of time to mentor someone with no experience. So, again, the ball is in your court to show us why we should talk to you. Because if we think you’d be a great addition to our team, we’d like to see if we can figure out how to employ you. </p> <li>Equal playing field</li> <p>From the highest C level executive to entry level anything, it all starts at the same place. If you’re going to be a Senior Software Engineer, our President of Marketing, or our new President of Engineering, your path goes through the very people you may have to manage. We treat everyone with dignity and respect. </p> </ul> <hr> <h2>Our Recruiting Process<span class="h2-bg" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-=""></span></h2> <p> You’re gracious enough to submit a resume to us.</p> <p> If what you’ve submitted looks promising, you’ll get an email asking you to take a test to demonstrate your skills, complete a writing test, and/or set up an initial phone interview. We try to cap initial phone interviews at around 30 minutes. We will typically want to discuss what you’ve done, who you are and why you want to work at Two Barrels. If we think your skills and the way you work would mesh well with our team, you’ll be invited to come in for an interview with some people from the team. You don’t need to perform a skit or anything, but if you want a job, you do need to explain what skills you have and why you think you’d be a great addition to the Two Barrels team. It’s up to you to bring a laptop, code, printouts, writing samples, metrics, designs, or whatever else you can think of that would explain why we should hire you. You can bring as much or as little as you’d like. You can wear something nice, or you can wear the same clothes you’ve been wearing for the last few days. It’s your time to shine. </p> <hr> <h2>The Second Interview<span class="h2-bg" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-=""></span></h2> <p> If you knock our socks off with the initial interview, you might be asked to come back for a second round. This is where we spend as much time as needed getting to know you, introducing you to people on the team, discussing our technologies in more depth, and really trying to see if there’s some warm fuzzies going on and if we’d like to work together. </p> <hr></span> <div class="apply-cta" data-aos="fade-up"> <div class="content-cta"> <h2>Sound good?</h2> <p>Apply directly on our website</p> </div> <div class="jobs-cta"> <a href="https://shuffo.com/apply.html"><button>Apply now</button></a> </div> </div> </div> </section> <div class="bg transition-dog"></div> </main> <footer> <div class="footer-wrapper container"> <div class="logo"><img src="logo-min.b1c64514.png" alt=""></div> <div class="social"> <a href="#"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a> <a href="#"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a> <a href="#"><i class="fab fa-tumblr"></i></a> <a href="#"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a> </div> <div class="address"> <p>401 W. 1st Ave</p> <p>Spokane, WA 99201</p> <p>(509) 315-1149</p> </div> </div> </footer> <div class="loading"> <svg viewBox="25 25 50 50"><circle cx="50" cy="50" r="20"/></svg> </div> <script type="text/javascript" src="app.1a600ea5.js"></script>
