                    <h2>Our <span class="head_orange">Humble</span> Beginnings</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Two Barrels LLC was started by a renegade group of super nerds and awkward employees who worked
                        for a
                        company called
                        <a href="https://www.registeredagentsinc.com/">Registered Agents Inc.</a> As this group of brave
                        technology warriors
                        grew, it became more and more apparent that they weren’t just the “other guys” anymore. They
                        were an
                        army, an entire
                        floor, a group of competitive fighters who were highly talented and powerful but produced
                        results
                        similar to
                        teenagers firing off scud missiles for fun.</p>
                    <p>When looking back, historians may well argue over the exact causes and catalysts that led to the
                        eventual creation of Two Barrels. While the work lives of these super geeks weren’t
                        horrible—they
                        worked in a relaxed corporate environment, set their own priorities, and had all the cool
                        hipster
                        office crap like ping pong, pool, air hockey, and shuffleboard —things were always a little off.
                        While getting coffee, the Software&nbsp;Engineer would field questions from the “normal people”
                        wondering why they couldn’t scan documents to their computers. Or while eating lunch, the
                        Front-End
                        Developer would be asked when they could reinstall Word on someone’s computer. Our Senior
                        Network
                        and Systems Engineer would be asked to fix a content typo on a website…</p>
                    <p>Eventually, they pitched an idea they thought would solve the problem: to be their own company.
                        The
                        organization embraced this idea of separation. Within months, an old furniture store was
                        purchased
                        and renovated into a killer 5,500 square foot office for the technology division to work out of,
                        free of the burdens of those who just didn’t understand what on earth they actually do, how they
                        function, how they work, or just how talented they really are.</p>

                        Now, we’d like to say that as an organization, our parent company was so in touch with their
                        employees’ feelings that they wanted to give them their own building, but the reality is this:
                        anyone working on a computer, software, website, systems or networking, has always been one of
                        “those people”.

                        They usually get stuffed in a crappy closet with no windows. Or worse yet, labeled as a cool,
                        modern startup and crammed like sardines into no-elbow-room sweatshops labeled and packaged with
                        a company name that isn’t spelled correctly.

                        No, the truth is that these people… these coders, developers, writers, marketers, engineers,
                        administrators…their bosses have always tried to figure them out… given their best efforts to
                        make them happy…tried to learn what makes them happy…tried to make it happen…only to utterly
                        fail. Why? Their bosses tried to stuff them in the normal box, and treat them like normal people
                        employees. Normal to them that is… but to a coder normal isn’t what’s normal to a CEO or
                        Accountant. That’s not normal at all.

                        We ask creative people to be creative and then make them work in an environment and with people
                        that aren’t like them. Yeah. Two Barrels was thought up as an idea to let coders becoders. Let
                        writers be writers.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the end of the day, we wanted to provide a high paying job for these folks and an
                        environment that makes them comfortable and happy. But at a minimum, try to get out of
                        the way and let people be what they are. And that required a separation. Translation: we
                        love them so much, we bought them their own office and let them form their own company.
